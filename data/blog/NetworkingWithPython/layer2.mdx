# Project Description

Welcome to Networking With Scapy, a Python project focused on studying and implementing various networking layers using Scapy. This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in networking protocols and packet manipulation techniques.

### ‚ú® Motive

The primary goal of this project is to deepen understanding and practical skills in networking by exploring different layers of the OSI model and implementing them using Scapy. By leveraging Scapy's capabilities, we can craft, send, receive, and analyze packets at different network layers, enabling us to grasp fundamental concepts more effectively.

#### Instructions

1. Ensure you have Scapy installed. If not, you can install it via pip:

   ```bash
   pip install scapy
   ```

## Sending Payload using Scapy over Ethernet

This Python script demonstrates how to use Scapy to craft and send Ethernet frames with a custom payload.

```python
from scapy.all import Ether, sendp, Raw

# Asking user for payload
user_input = input("Enter Payload: ")

# Encoding the string to bytes
payload_data = user_input.encode()

# Crafting Ethernet Frame with Payload
ether_frame = Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff", src="11:22:33:44:55:66") / Raw(load=payload_data)

# Print Ethernet Frame Summary
print("Ethernet Frame Summary:")
print(ether_frame.summary())

# Sending the Ethernet Frame
sendp(ether_frame, iface="eth0")


## Code Explanation

The function extracts source and destination MAC addresses from Ethernet frames.\
It attempts to decode the payload using UTF-8 encoding.\
If successful, it prints the destination MAC address and the decoded payload.\
If decoding fails (due to a non-UTF-8 payload), it prints an error message with the source MAC address;
